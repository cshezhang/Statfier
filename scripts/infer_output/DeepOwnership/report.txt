/home/vanguard/projects/SAMutator/src/test/java/codetoanalyze/java/racerd/DeepOwnership.java:16: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Unprotected write. Non-private method `DeepOwnership.globalNotOwnedBad()` writes to field `racerd.DeepOwnership.global.next` outside of synchronization.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
