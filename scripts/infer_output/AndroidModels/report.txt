/home/vanguard/projects/SAMutator/src/test/java/codetoanalyze/java/racerd/AndroidModels.java:63: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Unprotected write. Non-private method `AndroidModels.someResourceMethodsNotFunctionalBad()` writes to field `this.mField` outside of synchronization.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
  61.     public void someResourceMethodsNotFunctionalBad() {
  62.       // configuration can change whenever the device rotates
  63. >     mField = mResources.getConfiguration();
  64.     }
