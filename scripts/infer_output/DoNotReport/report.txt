/home/vanguard/projects/SAMutator/src/test/java/codetoanalyze/java/racerd/DoNotReport.java:20: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Unprotected write. Non-private method `DoNotReport.obviousRaceBad(...)` writes to field `this.mFld` outside of synchronization.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
  18.     // .inferconfig
  19.     void obviousRaceBad(int i) {
  20. >     mFld = i;
  21.     }
  22.   }
