/home/vanguard/projects/SAMutator/src/test/java/codetoanalyze/java/racerd/SubFld.java:28: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Read/Write race. Non-private method `SubFld.getG()` indirectly reads without synchronization from `this.g`. Potentially races with write in method `SubFld.setG()`.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
