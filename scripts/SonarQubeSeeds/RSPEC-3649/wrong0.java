  // If the special value "foo' OR 1=1 --" is passed as either the user or pass, authentication is bypassed
  // Indeed, if it is passed as a user, the query becomes:
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'foo' OR 1=1 --' AND pass = '...'
  // As '--' is the comment till end of line syntax in SQL, this is equivalent to:
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'foo' OR 1=1
  // which is equivalent to:
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1
  // which is equivalent to:
  // SELECT * FROM users
