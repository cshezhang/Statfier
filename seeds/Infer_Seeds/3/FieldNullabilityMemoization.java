/**
 * Nullsafe has a feature: field nullability is memoized within a method. In other words, nullsafe
 * assumes:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a) There will be no tricky multithreading.
 *   <li>b) If a field is set to non-null, the method won't call another method that will nullify it
 *       back.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This feature is unsound, but assumptions a) and b) mostly hold for real codebases, so
 * here nullsafe tradeoffs theoretical unsoundness for practical usability.
 *
 * <p>This class tests basic properties of this feature.
